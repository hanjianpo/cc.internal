## Introduction
```
As a full-stack framework, Play includes all the components you need to build Web Applications and REST services, such as an integrated HTTP server, form handling, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, a powerful routing mechanism, I18n support, and more. Play saves precious development time by directly supporting everyday tasks and hot reloading so that you can immediately view the results of your work.
